      Basic usage:
        fortress  # Works immediately, all git features included

      === CD-ON-EXIT FEATURE (Optional) ===
      To enable the 'c' key to change your shell's directory:

      Bash/Zsh - Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
        source #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/fortress/fortress.sh

      Fish - Add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish:
        source #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/fortress/fortress.fish

      Then restart your shell or source the config file.

      With shell integration, press 'c' on any directory to cd there and exit.
